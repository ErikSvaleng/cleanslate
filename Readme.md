# CleanSlate Javascript Starting point

This is a simple repo to provide a starting point for a new JavaScript app with webpack.

Just type `npm install` and then `npm start`, to fire up webpacks dev-server. Now you can code away!

## Usage
If you get to the point where you want to check in your code to source controll, you can perform the following steps:
1. Delete the .git folder in this project and `git init` in the console
2. Delete, or substitute for your own, the *Readme.md* and *License.txt* files.
3. In *Package.json* at least edit the following fields: Name, Description, Author.

## Template
This repo uses the HtmlWebpackPlugin with a custom template. The template body has a div element with id `app`. I've also included a link to a bootstrap 4 cdn, so any prototype will look ok from the get-go.

## Intended use
This is just intended for personal use. I don't want to set up webpack every time I want to try something out. But I do enjoy working with webpacks dev-server, so that's why I've got this repo set up.
